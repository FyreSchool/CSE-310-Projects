# Overview

This program is a program that every programmer should write at least once for each language that they use. That is the "Hello World" program. This is a staple for every beginner programmer and every once and a while I find myself writing it just for fun. This simple program will write out the words hello world in the console. This is a great way to start someoneâ€™s programming journey and that is why I am writing this program.
